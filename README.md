# goit-react-hw-08-phonebook

the goit-react-hw-08-phonebook project was created as part of the GoIt course.

The goit-react-hw-08-phonebook project is a refactored goit-react-hw-07-phonebook project. in the eighth project we no longer use mockapi.io for the backend, it has been replaced with a special backend that supports JWT, therefore the JWT itself and routing have been added.
